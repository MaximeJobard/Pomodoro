# Pomodoro Timer
It is a timer for chaining cycles with work phases and break phases, also known as the Pomodoro method.

## Description
All you have to do is click on the start button to start the timer and the program will automatically change between each phase at the end of the timer. This can be seen by the color of the page that changes (red for the work phase and green for my pause phase). Once the timer is started you can reset it at any time.

## Configuration
This application allows you to choose the time of each cycle yourself in the settings menu. Once in this menu there are two fields to fill out. The first is for the number of minutes of each work phase and the other for the number of minutes of the break phases. Once the application is configured, you can validate by clicking OK.
